# Mud Pie

Mud Pie is a *dirt simple* tool for generating baked websites.

## What's a baked website?

See:

- [A Plea for Baked Weblogs](http://inessential.com/2011/03/16/a_plea_for_baked_weblogs)
- [Bake, Don't Fry](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000404)

## Aren't there dozens of other tools that do this?

Yes. See:

- Jekyll
- nanoc

Mud Pie is loosely based on Jekyll, and is sort of compatible.

## What makes Mud Pie different?

Instead of regenerating every page of your site each time, Mud Pie builds and
maintains an index of pages, so that it can be smart enough to update only the
pages that need to be updated.
